# mp-bit-trees-maven

A mini-project exploring bit trees (a form of binary tree) and their use in translating between alphabets, particularly in translating to and from braille.

**Instructions for use**

Note: Currently not fully done! Only bitTreeNode and a non-working set/get are completely, but I felt bad submitting absolutely nothing so I figured I'd still submit, maybe get feedback and finish it on a redo.
