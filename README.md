# mp-bit-trees-maven

A mini-project exploring bit trees (a form of binary tree) and their use in translating between alphabets, particularly in translating to and from braille.

**Authors**

* Sam Schmidt
* Samuel A. Rebelsky (starter code)

**Acknowledgements**

* Used the BinaryTree<T> class from the tree traversal lab as an outline for the BitTreeNode
* Used eboard 25 (https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Fa/eboards/eboard25-1) for help in the BrailleAsciiTables
* Used the MP 10 ASsignment page for some of the documentation lines of methods.

**Instructions for use**

Note: Currently not fully done! Only bitTreeNode and a non-working set/get are completely. Everything is still in a preliminary state and so the program cannot be run yet.
